# ✊🖐✌️ Rock Paper Scissors

A classic Rock Paper Scissors game built with Python.  
Created while learning Python GUI programming and event-driven logic, this mini-project lets users play against the computer with a simple, intuitive interface.

## 📌 Features

- Play Rock Paper Scissors against a computer opponent  
- GUI with buttons for **Rock**, **Paper**, and **Scissors**  
- Displays player’s choice, computer’s choice, and the result (Win / Lose / Draw)  
- Keeps running score across rounds  
- Beginner-friendly, well-commented code

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer      | Tech |
|------------|------|
| **Language** | Python |
| **GUI** | Tkinter *(Python standard library)* |
| **Core Libs** | `random` – to generate computer moves<br>`tkinter` – to build the interface |

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-paper-scissors.git
   cd rock-paper-scissors
   ```

2. **Run the game**
   ```bash
   python rock_paper_scissors.py
   ```

> **Tip:** No external dependencies required—Tkinter ships with the standard Python installation.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Python fundamentals and control flow  
- Tkinter widgets, layouts, and event handling  
- Using the `random` module for game logic  
- Structuring functions for clean, readable code

## 💡 Motivation

After building my Dice Simulator, I wanted to continue exploring Python GUIs with a slightly more interactive game. Rock Paper Scissors was the perfect next step to practice event-driven logic and enhance my GUI design skills.  
This project further strengthened my understanding of Python, Tkinter, and basic game mechanics.
